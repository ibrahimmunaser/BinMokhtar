## ✅ **What's Fixed**

### Before (Broken):
❌ Products only showed alert
❌ Products not saved
❌ Dashboard didn't update
❌ Products disappeared on refresh

### After (Working):
✅ Products saved to localStorage
✅ Dashboard shows new products immediately
✅ Products persist after page refresh
✅ Shop page shows new products
✅ Category counts update automatically
✅ Delete works properly
✅ All data persists

---

## 🔄 **How Data Persistence Works**

### localStorage System:
```javascript
// Products saved to browser's localStorage
// Key: 'bmr_admin_products'
// Survives page refreshes!
// Cleared only when you clear browser data

// Categories also saved
// Key: 'bmr_admin_categories'
```

### Data Flow:
```
1. Fill form → Click "Create Product"
2. Product saved to localStorage
3. Dashboard refreshes automatically
4. Product appears in table
5. Shop page shows new product
6. Data persists after refresh!
```

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin
2. See all products in the table
3. Stats update automatically

### In Store:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/shop
2. Your new products appear immediately!
