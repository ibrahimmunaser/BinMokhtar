## 🌐 View Your Site

**Open in browser:** http://localhost:3000

You should see a **fully functional homepage** with:
- Professional hero section
- Product category tiles
- Customer reviews
- Brand story
- And more!

---

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

### To Add Real Data:

1. **Deploy Firebase Rules**:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only storage
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

2. **Add Products to Firestore** (via Firebase Console):
   - See `BUILD_STATUS.md` for exact JSON examples
   - Collections needed: `variants`, `products`, `home`, `settings`, `reviews`

3. **Replace Placeholder Images**:
   - Upload real images to Firebase Storage
   - Update Firestore documents with new image URLs

### To Continue Development:

The foundation is complete! Next priorities (see TODO list in README.md):

1. **Product Catalog** (`/shop`, `/category/*`)
2. **Product Detail Pages** (`/product/[slug]`)
3. **Cart & Checkout** (Stripe integration)
4. **Admin Dashboard** (product management)
5. **Search** functionality
6. **Full i18n** (EN/AR switching)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you see errors:

1. **Clear cache**:
```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run dev
```

2. **Reinstall dependencies**:
```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install
```

3. **Check Firebase config**:
   - Ensure `.env.local` exists (or app uses fallback credentials)
   - Verify Firebase project is active

### If fonts don't load:
- This is normal on first visit - they download from Google Fonts
- Subsequent page loads will be faster

### If images are broken:
- This is expected - using placeholder SVG until real images are added
- Upload images to Firebase Storage and update URLs
