    match /products/{imageId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if true;
      allow delete: if true;
    }
    
    // Content images
    match /content/{imageId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if true;
      allow delete: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Click "Publish"

  └── 1234567892-ghi789.webp
```

### Public URLs:
```
https://storage.googleapis.com/binmokhtar2-967ad.firebasestorage.app/products/1234567890-abc123.jpg
```

### Firestore Product Document:
```json
{
  "name": "Premium White Thobe",
  "images": [
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/.../image1.jpg",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/.../image2.jpg",
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/.../image3.jpg"
  ],
  "thumbnail": "https://storage.googleapis.com/.../image1.jpg"
}
```

## 🎨 **BEST PRACTICES**

### Image Guidelines:
- **Size:** 1000x1000px minimum for main image
- **Format:** JPG or PNG (WebP for better compression)
- **Quality:** High quality (80-90%)
- **File Size:** Keep under 1MB per image
- **Count:** 3-5 images per product ideal

### Photography Tips:
- Use consistent lighting
- Plain background (white/light gray)
- Show product from multiple angles
- Include detail shots (fabric, stitching)
- Show product in use (lifestyle shots)

### Upload Order:
1. Main product image (front view)
2. Back view
3. Side views
4. Detail shots
5. Lifestyle/context shots

## 🔒 **SECURITY NOTES**

### Current Rules (Development):
```
allow read: if true;   // Anyone can view
allow write: if true;  // Anyone can upload
allow delete: if true; // Anyone can delete
```

**This is for development/testing!**

### Production Rules (Update Later):
```
allow read: if true;   // Anyone can view
allow write: if request.auth != null;  // Only authenticated
allow delete: if request.auth != null; // Only authenticated
```

**After adding Firebase Authentication for admin, update the rules!**

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### "Upload failed" error:
- ✅ Check Storage rules are published
- ✅ Verify file is under 5MB
- ✅ Make sure it's an image file
- ✅ Check internet connection

### "CORS error":
- ✅ Rules should auto-configure CORS
- ✅ Wait 1-2 minutes after publishing rules
- ✅ Refresh the page

### "Permission denied":

- ✅ Try refreshing Firebase Console

### Images don't show:
