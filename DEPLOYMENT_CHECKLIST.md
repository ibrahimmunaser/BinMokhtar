## üìù Important Notes

1. **Firebase Config is Hardcoded:** Your Firebase credentials are now directly in `lib/firebase.ts`. This is fine for Firebase Web SDK (these are meant to be public), but keep your Admin SDK keys secret!

2. **Admin Access:** Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAILS` with your Google account email to access `/admin`

3. **Service Account Key:** Download from Firebase Console ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts ‚Üí Generate New Private Key. See `FIREBASE_ADMIN_SETUP.md` for details.

4. **Security Rules:** Must be deployed before going live to protect your data!

## üîê Security Reminders

- ‚úÖ Firebase Web SDK keys are safe to expose (they're public by design)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin SDK private keys must NEVER be committed to git
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Deploy Firestore rules to restrict write access
- ‚úÖ Only allow admin emails to access admin panel
