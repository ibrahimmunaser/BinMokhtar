# Troubleshooting: Create Product Button Not Working

## üîç Issue

The "Create Product" button is disabled even after filling all fields.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Added

I've added a **debug panel** that shows exactly which fields are causing validation issues!

### What You'll See Now

When the button is disabled, you'll see a **yellow box** at the top of the form that shows:
- Which fields have validation errors
- What the error messages are
- What needs to be fixed

Example:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Form Validation Issues:
‚Ä¢ images: At least 1 product image is required
‚Ä¢ variants: At least 1 variant is required
‚Ä¢ tags: At least 2 tags are required
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Work Top to Bottom
Fill the form from top to bottom:
1. Basic Info
2. Images
3. Variants (sizes/colors/stock)
4. Tags
5. Metrics (optional)

### Tip 2: Watch the Debug Panel
The yellow panel disappears when all validation passes!

### Tip 3: Stock Can Be Zero
You don't need to set stock > 0 for all variants.
Stock = 0 is valid (means out of stock).

### Tip 4: Use Quick Set All
In the stock matrix, use "Quick Set All" to set all variants to the same stock level quickly.
