      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if true;
      allow delete: if true;
    }
    
    // Content images
    match /content/{imageId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if true;
      allow delete: if true;

## 🚀 **STEP-BY-STEP CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Open Firebase Console
- [ ] Go to Storage section
- [ ] Click "Get Started"
- [ ] Choose "Production mode"
- [ ] Select location (us-central1)
- [ ] Wait for initialization
- [ ] Click "Rules" tab
- [ ] Paste security rules

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### Storage Bucket Name:
Firebase creates bucket: `binmokhtar2-967ad.appspot.com`

This might be different from what's in your config (`.firebasestorage.app`), but Firebase Admin SDK will handle this automatically.

### First Time Setup:
Storage initialization takes 10-30 seconds. If you get errors immediately after enabling, wait a minute and try again.

### Storage Rules:
The rules above allow public uploads for development. In production, you should restrict writes to authenticated admins only.

---

## 🎉 **RESULT**

After completing these steps:

✅ Firebase Storage enabled  
✅ Storage bucket created  
✅ Security rules set  
✅ Ready to upload images!

**Go enable Storage now, then try uploading!** 📸

## 🔍 **HOW TO VERIFY**

### Check if Storage is enabled:
1. Firebase Console → Storage
2. Should see dashboard with "Files" tab
3. Should see your bucket name
4. Should be able to upload test files manually

### Test Upload:
1. Go to admin panel
2. Add product
3. Upload image
4. Should see success message
5. Check Firebase Storage - image should appear in `/products` folder

**Enable Firebase Storage first, then uploads will work!** 🚀
